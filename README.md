# DVD Screensaver
The DVD screensaver is a classic image that appears on a television or computer screen when a DVD player is idle for an extended period. The screensaver displays a bouncing DVD logo that moves around the screen and changes direction when it hits the edge of the screen. The DVD screensaver became famous in the early 2000s and was often used as a test of the display quality of televisions and computer monitors.

The DVD screensaver was originally created by a company called Xing Technology, which was later acquired by RealNetworks. The bouncing DVD logo was included as part of the DVD player software and became an iconic symbol of the early days of digital video. The screensaver is no longer used as much today, as most modern televisions and computer monitors have built-in screen savers or energy-saving modes that automatically turn off the screen after a period of inactivity. However, it remains a nostalgic reminder of the early days of digital technology.
